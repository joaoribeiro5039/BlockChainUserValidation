# Blockchain Program with Redis Backend

This Python program implements a simple blockchain using Redis as the backend data store. The blockchain consists of blocks, each containing various types of data. The program allows you to create and manage blocks related to users and zones.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

1. Python 3.x
2. Redis server (either installed locally or accessible through a network connection)

## Dependencies

This program uses the following Python libraries:

- hashlib: Used for cryptographic hashing of block data.
- redis: Python client for Redis, used to interact with the Redis server.
- pydantic: Used for data validation and serialization.
- json: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- datetime: For timestamping block creation.
- random: To generate random data for users and zones.
- os: To fetch environment variables.

You can install the required dependencies using `pip` with the following command:

```
pip install hashlib redis pydantic
```

## Configuration

Before running the program, ensure that the Redis server is running and accessible. You can set the Redis host address by providing the `REDIS_HOST` environment variable. If the `REDIS_HOST` environment variable is not set, the default value will be `"localhost"`. Make sure the Redis server has appropriate settings, including password protection if required.

## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import hashlib
import redis
from pydantic import BaseModel
import json
from datetime import datetime
import random
import os
```

2. Define the Redis host address using environment variables:

```python
global REDIS_Host
REDIS_Host = os.getenv("REDIS_HOST")
if REDIS_Host is None:
    REDIS_Host = "localhost"
```

3. Implement the Block class:

```python
class Block:
    # ... (See the provided code for the complete Block class implementation)
```

4. Define functions to create different types of blocks:

```python
def Create_Genesis_Block():
    # ...

def Create_User_Block(index, user_ID, authorizationlevel_id, prev_hash):
    # ...

def Create_Zone_Block(index, Zone_ID, RequiredLevel_ID, prev_hash):
    # ...

def Create_Move_Block(index, user_ID, from_id, to_id, prev_hash):
    # ...
```

5. Initialize the Redis client:

```python
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host=REDIS_Host, port=6379, decode_responses=True)
```

6. Implement block creation and chain management:

```python
# ...
while True:
    # ...
```

7. Run the program:

```bash
python your_program_name.py
```

## Important Note

This program is a basic demonstration of a blockchain using Redis as a backend. In a real-world scenario, you may need to implement more sophisticated features, security measures, and consensus algorithms for a robust and secure blockchain implementation.

Feel free to modify and extend the program as needed for your specific use case.
