# FastAPI User Validation Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides details about the FastAPI application designed for user validation between zones based on their Authorization Level. The application utilizes blockchain technology to validate and securely store user data. FastAPI is a modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Web3.py (Python library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)
- Solidity (for smart contract development on the blockchain)

## Setup

1. Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a higher version installed on your system.

2. Install FastAPI: Use pip to install FastAPI.

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

3. Install Pydantic: Pydantic is used for data validation and serialization.

```bash
pip install pydantic
```

4. Install Web3.py: Web3.py is required to interact with the blockchain.

```bash
pip install web3
```

5. Setup Blockchain: Deploy the required smart contract on the blockchain to store user data securely.

## Application Overview

The FastAPI application will expose endpoints to validate users based on their Authorization Level for accessing specific zones. The data related to user validation will be stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-resistant and transparent validation.

### Data Model

We will use Pydantic models to define the data structure for the user validation.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserValidation(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    authorization_level: int
    zone: str
```

### Endpoints

The FastAPI application will expose the following endpoints:

1. **Validate User** - To validate the user's authorization level for accessing a specific zone.

   **Endpoint:** `/validate_user`

   **HTTP Method:** POST

   **Request Body:**

   ```json
   {
       "user_id": "user123",
       "zone": "zoneA"
   }
   ```

   **Response:**

   - `200 OK` with the response body containing the validation status (e.g., `{"valid": true}` or `{"valid": false}`).

2. **Add User Validation Data** - To add user validation data to the blockchain.

   **Endpoint:** `/add_user_validation`

   **HTTP Method:** POST

   **Request Body:**

   ```json
   {
       "user_id": "user123",
       "authorization_level": 2,
       "zone": "zoneA"
   }
   ```

   **Response:**

   - `200 OK` with the response body confirming the successful addition of data.

## Blockchain Interaction

The application will interact with the blockchain to store and retrieve user validation data. A smart contract will be deployed on the blockchain to manage this data securely.

The smart contract should include functions to:

- Add user validation data.
- Retrieve user validation data by user ID and zone.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the blockchain is set up, and the smart contract is deployed.

2. Run the FastAPI application.

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

3. The FastAPI application will now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

4. Use API clients like `curl`, `httpie`, or any other tool to interact with the API.

## Security Considerations

1. Ensure that the blockchain network is secure and properly configured.

2. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive endpoints and operations.

3. Use HTTPS to secure communication with the API.

4. Apply rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the FastAPI application for user validation between zones based on Authorization Level. By utilizing blockchain technology, the application ensures data integrity and transparency, making it suitable for various use cases that require secure and tamper-resistant validation. Ensure to follow the security considerations to maintain the robustness of the application.
